## Course 2 Glossary

* **Action-oriented question:** A question formulated to prompt solutions and lead to change.
* **Algorithm:** A set of instructions or rules that govern a specific task or process. 
* **AVERAGE:** A spreadsheet function that calculates and returns the average of values from a selected range of cells.
* **Big data:** Large and complex datasets, often collected over extended periods, allowing analysis of broader business trends.
* **Borders:** Lines that can be added around individual cells or groups of cells in a spreadsheet to improve visual organization.
* **Cell reference:** A reference to a specific cell or range of cells within a worksheet, typically used in formulas and functions. 
* **Cloud:** A network of remote servers that store data online, accessible from various devices.
* **COUNT:** A spreadsheet function that counts the number of cells within a specified range that meet a certain criteria.
* **Dashboard:** A visual tool that displays live, incoming data for real-time monitoring.
* **Data analysis process:** The six-stage process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) used to extract insights from data and drive informed decisions.
* **Data-inspired decision-making:** The process of exploring and analyzing various data sources to find common patterns and trends that guide decision-making.
* **Data life cycle:** The stages data goes through, including planning, capturing, managing, analyzing, archiving, and destruction.
* **Equation (Math expression):** A formula representing a calculation involving mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
* **Fill handle:** A small square box in the lower-right corner of a selected cell used to drag and copy formatting or formulas to neighboring cells.
* **Filtering:** The process of temporarily hiding rows that don't meet specific criteria, allowing you to focus on relevant data without altering the original spreadsheet.
* **Header:** The top row in a spreadsheet that labels the type of data contained in each column, providing context and improving readability.
* **Leading question:** A question phrased to influence the answer towards a specific direction.
* **Math expression (Math function):** A formula representing a mathematical calculation (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE) used within spreadsheets.
* **MAX:** A spreadsheet function that returns the largest numeric value from a selected range of cells.
* **Measurable question:** A question formulated such that the answer can be quantified and assessed.
* **Metric:** A single, quantifiable measure used to track performance or progress.
* **Metric goal:** A measurable objective set by a company and evaluated using metrics.
* **MIN:** A spreadsheet function that returns the smallest numeric value from a selected range of cells.
* **Open data:** Data sets that are freely available to the public for anyone to use.
* **Operator:** A symbol representing a specific operation or calculation to be performed in a formula (e.g., "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction).
* **Order of operations (PEMDAS):** A set of rules defining the sequence in which mathematical operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) are performed within a formula to ensure accurate calculations.
* **Pivot chart:** A visual representation (chart) created from data summarized in a pivot table.
* **Pivot table:** A data analysis tool used to sort, reorganize, group, count, total, or average data in a spreadsheet.
* **Problem domain:** The specific area of analysis that encompasses all activities affecting or affected by the problem you're trying to solve.
* **Problem types:** The various categories of problems data analysts encounter, including classification, identifying connections, pattern recognition, theme identification, prediction, and anomaly detection.
* **Qualitative data:** Subjective and descriptive data that captures qualities or characteristics.
* **Quantitative data:** Objective and measurable data, typically numerical in nature.
* **Range:** A rectangular block of cells in a spreadsheet consisting of two or more cells.
* **Reframing:** Restating a problem or challenge from a different perspective, potentially leading to new solutions.
* **Relevant question:** A question directly related and important to the problem you're trying to solve.
* **Report:** A static collection of data, often presented in a table format, that is periodically generated and shared with stakeholders.
* **Return on investment (ROI):** A financial metric that evaluates the success of an investment by comparing the profit gained to the cost of the investment.
* **Revenue:** The total income generated by a business through the sale of goods or services.
* **Scope of work (SOW):** A formal document outlining the tasks, deliverables, and timelines agreed upon for a project.
* **Small data:** Relatively small and specific data sets, often collected over short periods, used for day-to-day decision
