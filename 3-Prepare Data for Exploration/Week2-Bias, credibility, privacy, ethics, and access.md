Our brains are biologically designed to streamline thinking and make quick judgments.
#### Bias
A preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing. It can be conscious or subconscious. Once we know and accept that we have bias, we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it.
#### Data Bias
A type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction.
- **Sampling bias**: When a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole. You can avoid this by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. **Unbiased sampling** results in a sample that's representative of the population being measured. Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data is to bring the results to life with visualizations. This will help you easily identify any misalignment with your sample.
- **Observer bias**(experimenter bias/research bias): The tendency for different people to observe things differently.
- **Interpretation bias**: The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way.
- **Confirmation bias**: The tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.

How we can go about finding and identifying ***good data*** sources: **Reliable**(Good data sources are reliable), **Original**(To make sure you're dealing with good data, be sure to validate it with the original source), **Comprehensive**(The best data sources contain all critical information needed to answer the question or find the solution), **Current**(The best data sources are current and relevant to the task at hand), **Cited**(Citing makes the information you're providing more credible). Every good solution is found by avoiding bad data. For good data, stick with vetted public data sets, academic papers, financial data and governmental agency data.

#### Ethics
Well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness or specific virtues.
#### Data ethics
Well- founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used.

<details><summary>Some aspects of data ethics</summary><ul>
 <li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Individuals who own the raw data they provide, and they have primary control over its usage, how it's processed and how it's shared.</li>
 <li><strong>Transaction transaparency</strong>: All data processing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by the individual who provides their data.</li>
 <li><strong>Consent</strong>: An individual's right to know explicit details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it.</li>
 <li><strong>Currency</strong>: Individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions.</li>
 <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. This is sometimes called information privacy or data protection. <ul><li>Protection from unauthorized access to our private data</li>
  <li>Freedom from inappropriate use of our data</li>
  <li>The right to inspect, update, or correct our data</li>
  <li>Ability to give consent to use our data</li>
  <li>Legal right to access our data</li></ul></li>
 <li><strong>Openness</strong>: Free access, usage, and sharing of data.</li>
 </ul></details>
 
 #### Data anonymization
 **Personally identifiable information**, or PII, is information that can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. **Data anonymization** is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating that kind of information. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values. Data anonymization applies to all personally identifiable information, including text and images. <br> **De-identification** is a process used to wipe data clean of all personally identifying information.

For data to be considered open, it has to meet all three of these standards:
- Availability and access: Open data must be available as a whole, preferably by downloading over the Internet in a convenient and modifiable form.
- Reuse and redistribution: Open data must be provided under terms that allow reuse and redistribution including the ability to use it with other datasets.
- Universal participation: Everyone must be able to use, reuse, and redistribute the data. There shouldn't be any discrimination against fields, persons, or groups.

#### Data interoperability
Interoperability is key to open data's success. It is the ability of data systems and services to openly connect and share data. Different databases using common formats and terminology is an example of interoperability.

One of the biggest benefits of open data is that credible databases can be used more widely. Basically, this means that all of that good data can be leveraged, shared, and combined with other data. But it is important to think about the individuals being represented by the public, open data, too. 

#### The open data debate: What data should be publicly available?
One of the biggest benefits of open data is that credible databases can be used more widely. Basically, this means that all of that good data can be leveraged, shared, and combined with other data. This could have a huge impact on scientific collaboration, research advances, analytical capacity, and decision-making. But it is important to think about the individuals being represented by the public, open data, too. 

Third-party data is collected by an entity that doesn’t have a direct relationship with the data. You might remember learning about this type of data earlier. For example, third parties might collect information about visitors to a certain website. Doing this lets these third parties create audience profiles, which helps them better understand user behavior and target them with more effective advertising. 

Personal identifiable information (PII) is data that is reasonably likely to identify a person and make information known about them. It is important to keep this data safe. PII can include a person’s address, credit card information, social security number, medical records, and more. 

Everyone wants to keep personal information about themselves private. Because third-party data is readily available, it is important to balance the openness of data with the privacy of individuals.
