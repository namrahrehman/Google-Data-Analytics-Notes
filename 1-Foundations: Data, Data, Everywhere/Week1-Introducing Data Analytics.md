### Data
Data is a collection of facts that can be used to draw conclusions, make predictions, and assist in decision-making. 

### Data Analysis 
Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

The six steps of the data analysis process are([data analysis life cycle](https://github.com/ksgr5566/Google-Data-Analytics/blob/main/1-Foundations:%20Data%2C%20Data%2C%20Everywhere/Week1-Introducing%20Data%20Analytics.md#data-analysis-life-cycle)): 
- **Ask** questions and define the problem.
- **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
- **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information. Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
- **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
- **Share** data with your audience.
- **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

Data science, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: ***machine learning, statistics, and analytics***.
These are separated by how many decisions you know you want to make before you begin with them.

If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics.
The excellence of statistics is rigor. They are very, very careful about protecting decision-makers from coming to the wrong conclusion.

If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI.
Performance is the excellence of the machine learning and AI engineer. 

But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What if what you're looking for is inspiration? You want to encounter your unknown unknowns. You want to understand your world. That is analytics.
The excellence of an analyst is speed. How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore it and discover the gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers

### Data Ecosystem
An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another.

Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.

For example, you could tap into your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews.

<br />

### Data Science
Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.

Data **scientists** create new questions using data, while **analysts** find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

<br />

### Data Analytics
Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data.

It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.

Data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, all fit under the data analytics umbrella.

<br />

### Data-driven Decision-making
Using facts to guide business strategy.

The first step in data-driven decision-making is figuring out the business need.

Data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition. To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem. These people are called **subject matter experts**, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.


<br />

### Gut Instinct
Gut instinct is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis.

At the heart of data-driven decision-making is data, so analysts are most effective when they ensure that facts are driving strategy.

Key Points:

**Bias**: Our past experiences and biases can influence gut feelings, leading to unbalanced decisions.

**Data for Objectivity**: Data helps remove personal biases and allows for a more objective view.

**Gut Instinct vs. Data Support**: Decisions based solely on gut feeling often lack data support and can lead to mistakes.

The Restaurant Example:

The passage highlights the dangers of relying solely on gut instinct through a restaurant example. A renowned chef, known for their successful restaurants elsewhere, partnered with an entrepreneur to open a new, uniquely themed establishment in a bustling downtown location.

The Problem:

Despite the chef's reputation, fundraising efforts fell short. The passage suggests this failure might have been avoided with proper research. Data analysis could have revealed that the target clientele in the chosen location differed significantly from the chef's existing customer base, potentially leading to a mismatch between the restaurant's concept and the local market.

Lesson Learned:

This example shows how neglecting data analysis in favor of gut instinct can lead to costly mistakes.

Additional Note:

While past experiences can sometimes provide valuable insights,  combining that experience with data analysis allows for a more informed and well-rounded approach to decision-making.

### Data Analysis Life Cycle
The process of going from data to decision.

Data goes through several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed, and reused. With a life cycle model, all key team members can drive success by planning work both up front and at the end of the data analysis process. While the data analysis life cycle is well known among experts, there isn't a single defined structure of those phases. There might not be one single architecture that’s uniformly followed by every data analysis expert, but there are some shared fundamentals in every data analysis process.

## Data Analysis Skills Required:

The passage highlights several inherent data analysis skills that are crucial for conducting an effective Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* **Curiosity:**  
  * This drives analysts to ask questions about the data and explore potential relationships between variables.  
  * Examples include:
      * How does budget impact opening weekend revenue?
      * Which genres perform better on opening weekends?
      * Is there a connection between release season and genre performance?
      * What additional data (e.g., audience demographics) might be helpful?
* **Understanding Context:**  
  * This involves interpreting the data within a broader context to understand the "why" behind the patterns observed.  
  * Examples include:
      * Considering factors like release date, holidays, and competition that might influence revenue.
      * Analyzing audience demographics (age, gender, etc.) to understand moviegoer preferences.
      * Recognizing seasonal variations in movie attendance patterns (e.g., family films during school breaks).
* **Technical Mindset:** This refers to a systematic and logical approach to data handling. It involves:
    * Cleaning, organizing, and preparing the data for analysis.
    * Selecting and using appropriate tools or software to manipulate and analyze the data.
    * Identifying and correcting errors in the data to prevent skewed results. 
* **Data Design:** This focuses on structuring and organizing information for efficient analysis. For instance:
    * Organizing data by revenue and genre to identify profitable genres.
    * Structuring the data in a way that facilitates the discovery of patterns and insights.
* **Data Strategy:** This involves planning and managing the resources used in data analysis. It includes:
    * Choosing the right tools based on the complexity of the data and desired outputs (e.g., simple dashboard vs. real-time data updates).
    * Prioritizing analyses based on their potential impact on business objectives (e.g., focusing on analyses impacting next quarter's revenue).
    * Effectively allocating resources (time, tools, effort) to achieve the desired outcomes.

**The Five Whys** is a simple but effective technique for identifying a root cause. It involves asking "Why?" repeatedly until the answer reveals itself. This often happens at the fifth “why,” but sometimes you’ll need to continue asking more times, sometimes fewer.
